# ðŸŒŒ 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is a simple 3D simulation of the solar system using OpenGL and GLUT.  
We used basic transformations like rotation, translation, and scaling to animate the planets around the sun.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time orbit animation
- Planets with different sizes, colors, and speeds
- Earth has a moon orbiting it
- Galaxy background image using SOIL texture loading
- Mouse drag to rotate the camera
- Scroll to zoom in/out

## ðŸ›  How we built it

We started by drawing spheres for each planet and updated their position using basic trigonometry.  
We added orbits using line loops and used timer functions for smooth animation.  
For the 3D view, we added camera controls and zoom functionality.  
The galaxy background was added using SOIL to load a texture.
